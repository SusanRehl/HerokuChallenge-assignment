# HerokuChallenge-assignment
Heroku setup solo challenge 6.8.16

Spin up an entirely new project. 
Set up a node project using npm init, create an http server and respond on port 3000 with “Hello world!”. 
Test the application locally in the browser.

Note: make sure you use listen(process.env.PORT || 3000); in order to support heroku’s automatic port assignment.
